<h4>Why is Pong Champ the best?</h4>
<p>
Pong Champ separates itself from other beer pong stats applications because it keeps track of so many stats that these other apps just don't have. It addition to the basic wins, losses, and shooting percentages, Pong Champ keeps track of unique stats like how many times you've been 'Heating Up' and 'On Fire' (for you NBA Jam Rule junkies), how many overtime games you've played, your highest win streak, your overall rank, and even how many times you've successfully completed a redemption. As well as individual stats, Pong Champ keeps team stats and game-by-game results, so you can settle any dispute about who won that game three weeks ago. To view all of the statistics Pong Champ records, simply enter a username above (it doesn't have to be a registered one) and the categories will appear. 
</p>

<h4>Other than unique stats, what does Pong Champ bring to the table?</h4>
<p>
Aside from the convenience of tracking games with your mobile device, Pong Champ also has some pretty cool features. An in-app team randomizer, to decide who is playing next or what the teams will be, when you just can't decide for yourselves. The ability to switch up the rules depending on which house rules you're playing with. An in-game shot-by-shot history to see who shot, what kind of shot it was, what happened, and how many cups were left at the time. And finally, for you gamblers, the app shows a pre-game odds window displaying the cup spread for each team (how many cups the team should win or lose by) and the associated odds.
